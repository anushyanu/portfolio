## VOI Rental System using Python 
---
### A Quick Intro about this Project:
    Here is a Python project,built using OOPS concept with classes and objects. Customer can request the VOI using their 
    id's and rental plans and id's are verified in the database(Sqlite).Also when the customer returns the VOI, the bill 
    gets generated according to their number of VOI and rental plans.Interestingly,we have interfaced the currency converter 
    API in this project for customers to use thier currency for paying it.
